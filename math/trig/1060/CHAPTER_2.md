# Trigonometry 1060 Chapter 2

## Review
* Pythagorean Theorem: 
    * **a^2 + b ^2 = c^2**
## Conversions
---
* Convert degrees to radians
    * **θ = α(π/180)**
        * α = the angle in degrees
* Convert radians to degrees
    * **θ = α(180/π)**
        * α = the angle in radians

## Measurments
---
 * Arc Length - the length that subtends the angle
    * **r(θ)**
        * where θ is the angle in radians
        * !important if the length is in degrees you must first convert it to radians with the method mentioned above

## Velocity
---
* Angular Velocity - how fast the angle is moving for given amount 
    * **θ/t** - where t = time
        * you can think of it as the angle is moving at theta degrees per the alloted amount of time
* Linear Velocity - how far it is moving in a linear direction
    * **S/t**
        * S = the arc length or the length subtending the angle
        * t = time

## Trigonometric Functions
---
* sin(θ) - (sine)
    * **opposite/hypotenuse**
* cos(θ) - (cosine)
    * **adjacent/hypotenuse**
* tan(θ) - (tangent)
    * **opposite/adjacent** 
    * **sin(θ)/cos(θ)**
* sec(θ) - (secant)
    * **is the reciprocal of cos(θ)**
    * **1/cos(θ)**
* csc(θ) - (cosecant)
    * **is the reciprocal of sin(θ)**
    * **1/sin(θ)**
* cot(θ) - *(cotangent)*
    * **adjacent/opposite**
    * **cos(θ)/sin(θ)**
> you can remember everything above with the following mnemonic **SOHCAHTOA**

## Trigonometric Graphs
---
* When graphing a trig function we can keep the following equation in mind
    * **f(x) = a(trig func(b(x) - c) + d**
        * a = the amplitude that the graph will reach also known as vertical dilation
            * if a is negative then the graph will be reflected over the x axis
        * b = (2π/b) the new period of the graph also known as horizontal translation by default it is 2π
            * if b is negative then the graph will be reflected over the y axis
        * c = the phase shift (horizontal translation)
        * d = the vertical shift (sinusoidal axis) (midline)

* cos(θ)
