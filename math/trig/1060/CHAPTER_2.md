# Trigonometry 1060 Chapter 2

## Basic
* Pythagorean Theorem: 
    * **a^2 + b ^2 = c^2**
## Conversions
---
* Convert degrees to radians
    * **θ = α(π/180)**
        * α = the angle in degrees
* Convert radians to degrees
    * **θ = α(180/π)**
        * α = the angle in radians

## Velocity
---
* Angular Velocity - how fast the angle is moving for given amount 
    * **θ/t** - where t = time
        * you can think of it as the angle is moving at theta degrees per the alloted amount of time
* Linear Velocity - how far it is moving in a linear direction
    * **S/t**
        * S = the arc length or the length subtending the angle
        * t = time
    * !important this only works of the S is in radians



## Trigonometric Functions
---
* sin(θ) - (sine)
    * **opposite/hypotenuse**
* cos(θ) - (cosine)
    * **adjacent/hypotenuse**
* tan(θ) - (tangent)
    * **opposite/adjacent** 
    * **sin(θ)/cos(θ)**
* sec(θ) - (secant)
    * **is the reciprocal of cos(θ)**
    * **1/cos(θ)**
* csc(θ) - (cosecant)
    * **is the reciprocal of sin(θ)**
    * **1/sin(θ)**
* cot(θ) - *(cotangent)*
    * **adjacent/opposite**
    * **cos(θ)/sin(θ)**
> you can remember everything above with the following mnemonic **SOHCAHTOA**
