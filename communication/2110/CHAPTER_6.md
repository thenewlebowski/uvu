### What is Culture?
* culture is defined differently by different people
* a group of people who, through a process of learning, can share perceptions of the world, which influence their beliefs, values, norms, and rules, eventually affecting one's behavior
* culture is formed by a group of people, a group that individuals participate in over a course of their lifetime
* humans are hardwired to learn culture
