### What is face-negotiation theory?
* Stella Ting-Toomey
* Face-negotiation theory to explain the importance of face within interpersonal interactions
* Face is the standing or position a person has in the eyes of others
* Individuals strive to create a positive version of their face in the eyes of the other person
* Three types of face:
    *Self-face: Concern for our face
    * Other-face: Concern for another person’s face
    * Mutual-face: Concern for both interactants and the relationship

### Seven assumptions of face-negotiation theory
1. People in all cultures try to maintain and negotiate face in all communication situations.
2. The concept of face is problematic in emotionally vulnerable situations.
3. The cultural variability dimensions of individualism-collectivism and small/large power distance shapes the orientations, movements, contents, and styles of facework.
4. Individualism-collectivism shapes members’ preferences for self-orientation facework versus other-orientation facework.
5. Small/large power distance shapes members’ preferences for horizontal-based facework versus vertical-based facework.
6. The cultural variability dimensions, in conjunction with individual, relational, and situational factors influence the use of particular facework behaviors in particular cultural scenes.
7. Intercultural facework competence refers to the optimal integration of knowledge, mindfulness, and communication skills in managing vulnerable identity-based conflict situations appropriately, effectively, and adaptively.
