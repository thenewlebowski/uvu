## What's introduced in this chapter?

* Bohr theory and the quantum mechanical theory
* what composes all matter?
* what makes one element different from another? how do the atoms of different elements differ from one another
* What are atoms composed of?
* how do we specify a given atom?
* do similarities between atoms and the elements they compose similar? what are those similarities?
* how do we create a model for the atom that explains similarities and differences among elements?
    * how do we use that model?
* how do we know numbers of atoms in an object?
    * for example how do we calculate the number of atoms in a penny?

## Introduction / Review

* there are more atoms in a grain of sand then there are grains of sand on the largest branches
* an atom is the smallest identifiable unit of an element
* 91 different elements in nature and consequently 91 different atoms

## Atom Attributes

* some elements are inert; they don't combine with other elements to form compounds
* other elements are reactive; they will form with other elements to create compounds and are not found in nature as pure elements
### Protons & Electrons
* the number of protons in an atom determine what it is.
    * also known as the **atomic number**
    * *Z* is typically the symbol used to represent the atomic number
    * the charge of a proton is assigned a numerical value of 1+ since they have a positive charge.
        * if the atomic number of 2 it has a charge of 2+ (before we take the electrons into account)
* a neutral atom has as many electons outside of its nucleus as protons inside of its nucleus
    * *TLDR*; if atom is neutral; count of eletrons = count of proton
* electrons have a very small mass compared to protons, 0.00055 amu, and are negatively charged
### Ions
* an atom can lose or gain one or more electrons
    * the atom becomes positive if the atom losses an electron
    * the atom becomes negative if the atom gains an electron
* when an atom loses/gains an electron it becomes an ***ion***
    * positive atoms are called cations<sup>+</sup>
    * negative atoms are called anions<sup>-</sup>

### Neutrons
* atoms also contain neutral particles called neutrons within their nuclei
* the number of neutrons in an element can very it isn't determined by the atomic number
* the sum of the number of neutrons and protons in the nueclus of a given atom is called its mass number and has the symbol *A*
    * in other words we can find the amount of neutrons by deducting the atomic mass(A) by the atomic number(Z)
    * ***neutrons = A - Z***
* atoms with the same atomic number but different numbers of neutrons are called ***isotopes***

## Subatomic Particles
        
| particle      |  mass(g)     | mass(amu)    | charge       |
| ------------  | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| proton        | 1.6726 * 10<sup>-24</sup> | 1.0073 |   +   |
| neutron       | 1.6749 * 10<sup>-24</sup> | 1.0087 |       |
| electron      | 0.000911 * 10<sup>-24</sup> | 0.000549 | - |

* atomic mass = ***(enter equation here)***

* when we specify any atom, isotope, or ion by specifying the number of each of the particles within it. This is usually done by listing its atomic number z its mass number ***A*** and its charge ***C*** we combine these with the atomic symbol x

    ***<sup>A</sup><sub>Z</sub>X<sup>C</sup>***

* although the charge is left out if the atom is neutral

* because every element has a unique atomic number, the chemical symbol ***X*** and the atomic number ***Z*** are redundant. So there is a briefer notation often used when refering to neutral atoms has the chemical symbol or name followed by a class and its mass number
    * ***X - A***

## 3.6 Atomic Mass
### Calculating Atomic Mass
* the atomic mass of any element is calculated with the followig formula.
    atomic mass = (fraction isotope<sub>1</sub>) * (mass isotope<sub>1</sub>) + (fractional isotope<sub>2</sub>) * (mass isotope<sub>2</sub>)
    * ie. chlorine has two isotopes
        * 75.77% abundance are chlorine 35(mass 34.97 amu)
        * 24.23% abundance are chlorine 37(mass 36.97 amu)
        * CI atomic mass = 0.7577(34.97 amu) + 0.2423(36.97 amu) = 34.45 amu

## 3.7 The Periodic Law
* dmitri mendeleev (1834 - 1907) created teh precursor to todays periodic table. he noticed patterns in increasing atomic sizes. he made the observation that if the listed the elements from least to highest atomic numbers that properties would recur in a periodic fashion.

## 3.8 A Theory that Explains the Periodic Law - The Bohr Model
* the Bohr model, is a theory for the way electrons behave in atoms that explains the periodic law and links the macroscopic properties of elements to the microscopic properties of their atoms

* Bohr specified each orbit with an integer ***n***, called the orbits quantum number. the higher the quantum number the higher the electrons energy Bohr also stipulated that the orbits could only hold a maximum number of electrons determined by the value of n as follows
    * Bohr orbit with n = 1:
        * holds a max of two electrons
    * Bohr orbit with n = 2:
        * holds a max of eight electrons
    * Bohr orbit with n = 3:
        * holds a max of eight electrons
* atoms with a full orbit are extremely stable
    * they are chemically inert and do not readily react with other elements

* atoms having outer orbits that are not full are unstable and will undergo chemical reactions with other elements to gain full outer orbits

* valence electrons
    * electrons that are in the furthest most orbit. these are important because they determine the elements properties

* the reactions an element undergoes is determined by the valence electrons

* elements with similar amount of valence electrons behave similarly in chemical reactions
